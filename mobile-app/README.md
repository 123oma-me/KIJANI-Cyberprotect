The demo highlights the solution's core value: Zero-Touch, Automated Threat Remediation.

Observe the green state: When the application first loads, observe the security dashboard displaying a safe  Alert state with a high Security Score (e.g., 99) .simulate an attack 

 (simulating an active phishing or ransomware attack).

Observe the red: After the simulation, observe the security dashboard displaying a Red Alert state with a low Security Score (e.g., 45) and an explicit warning (simulating an active phishing or ransomware attack).

Execute the Fix: Click the FIX IT NOW (Automated Repair) button. This simulates the proprietary AI/Cloud function triggering a background remediation process.
