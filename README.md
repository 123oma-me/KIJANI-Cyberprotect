### Live Testing Instructions

Judges are encouraged to interact with the Live App Demo Link to experience the Zero-Touch workflow:

1.  **Observe the Red Alert:** When the app loads, note the low **Score (45)** and the explicit warning message (simulating a ransomware attack).
2.  **Execute the Fix:** Click the **FIX IT NOW (Automated Repair)** button.
3.  **Confirm Success:** Observe the instant, non-loading screen transition to the **Green Success State (Score 95)**, which validates the speed and autonomy of the Kijani solution.
